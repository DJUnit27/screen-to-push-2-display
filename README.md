# Screen To Push 2 Display

Grabs a rectangular area of the screen and streams it to Push 2's display.

Requires imp.push Max Extension: https://github.com/impsnldavid/imp.push

Controls:

Open/Close: Turns on/off communication with Push's display.

Enable: Starts the capture of the computer screen.

Decks/Browser/User 1-2: Switch between captured areas from the computer screen. User views can be edited from Presentation Mode using the X, Y, Width, and Height values. "Store User 1-2" stores the current rectangle as User 1 or 2 presets.

Decks and Browser view are selectable from the Browse and Clip buttons on Push.

The "port" buttons let you select which Push port the patch will receve MIDI messages through. Push turns on by default in "Live mode", but once Live is launched it switches to "User mode" even if Live is closed. If the Browse and Clip buttons stop working, try changing the port selection.
