Requires imp.push Max Extension: https://github.com/impsnldavid/imp.push

Controls:

Open/Close: Turns on/off communication with Push's display.

Enable: Starts the capture of the computer screen.

Display 1-4: Switch between captured areas from the computer screen. Display views can be edited from Presentation Mode using the X, Y, Width, and Height values. "Store Display 1-4" stores the current rectangle as the corresponding display.

Displays 1 and 2 are selectable from the Browse and Clip buttons on Push.

Save/Load: Allows saving and loading of the 4 displays settings.

The "port" buttons let you select which Push port the patch will receve MIDI messages through. Push turns on by default in "Live mode", but once Live is launched it switches to "User mode" even if Live is closed. If the Browse and Clip buttons stop working, try changing the port selection.
